 Connectome File Format
========================

The Connectome File Format is used by the Connectome Viewer to organize multi-modal datasets for a single
subject or a study. The Connectome File Format Version 2.0 is released together with the Connectome File Format
Library (cfflib), enabling creation, manipulation and storage of its contained data.

To get started, you can look into the documentation for the `cfflib <http://cmtk.org/cfflib>`_
or explore the `connectome file data repository cffdata <http://github.com/LTS5/cffdata>`_.

The library and format heavily depends on neuroimaging data format reader/writers implemented in `Nibabel <http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/>`_.
