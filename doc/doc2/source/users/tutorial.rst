.. warning:: This content is deprecated with Connectome Viewer Version 2.0. Scripts that serve as tutorials will be
             exposed through the CodeOracle plugin.

The best way to learn how to use the Connectome Viewer is by example. The Code Oracle (Menu Bar) lets you
automatically create Python scripts for tasks you want to perform. Load a connectome file, double-click the
files you want to work with to load them into memory. Then, you can select tasks from the Code Oracle menu.
After setting parameters in a GUI or directly in the script, you can run the script (save it first) by pressing Ctrl-R,
and perform the requested task.

We are open to Code Oracle script contributions that might be useful for the neuroimaging connectome research community.
