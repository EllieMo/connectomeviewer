This displays a slice of brain tissue from brainmaps.org.

Idea
----
This could make a nice plugin for the ConnectomeViewer. An idea
would be to extend the Connectome File Format to contain slices
which are spatially located. At this location, a clickable box
might be displayed that pop-us up according slices using
PIL, matplotlib (os done here) or the web.
