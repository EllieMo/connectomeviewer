A set of converters written to produce data used for Connectome File Format
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/matlab2graphml
    Shows how a connectivity matrix of one subject might be

/ConnectomeWiki (to do)
    Shows how to create files for import into the ConnectomeWiki by
    the PyWikipedia Bot. Also exemplifies how to extract connectivity
    data from the ConnectomeWiki and generate a GraphML file out of it.
    
/gifti (to do)
    Shows how to create a valid Gifti File using a Python Script from
    a set of Vertices and Triangles. Also an example of adding metadata,
    labels and using the Gifti Library for doing data manipulation.
